## ðŸš€ Setup

Follow these steps to get the Ridfix project up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/AliouneDiagne/ridfix-ecommerce.git>
    cd ridfix-ecommerce
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the API URL.

    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```

4.  **Prepare Images**:
    Create a `public/images/` directory in the project root and place all product images and brand logos there. Ensure image filenames match those specified in `data/db.json` (e.g., `product-1.jpg`, `brand-logo-1.png`).

5.  **Start the API Server (JSON-Server)**:
    Open a **new terminal** in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm run serve:api
    ```
    This will start the mock backend server. Keep this terminal open while developing.

6.  **Start the Frontend Development Server**:
    Open another **new terminal** in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    (or `npm start`)
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port specified by Vite).

âœ¨ Features
The Ridfix application implements the following core and advanced features:
â€¢
Home & Catalog: Features a hero banner, promotional sections, and featured products. The catalog includes a responsive grid of 25 products, a live full-text search with debounce, comprehensive filters (category, brand, price range, availability), and sorting options (price, name, popularity).
â€¢
Product Detail: A dynamic page displaying product images (carousel), extended descriptions, technical specifications (tabbed view), simulated customer reviews with a submission form, and a wishlist toggle (ðŸ’–). It also suggests related products.
â€¢
Cart & Checkout: Users can add/remove products, modify quantities, and view dynamic subtotals. The cart content persists using LocalStorage. The checkout process is a guided 4-step flow covering shipping, billing, and payment (simulated) forms.
â€¢
Authentication: Includes dedicated Login and Registration forms with basic validation. It supports simulated user and admin roles, with authentication state persisted via LocalStorage.
â€¢
User Profile: A dashboard for logged-in users to modify personal data, view their order history, and manage addresses.
â€¢
Admin Dashboard: A protected administrative area (/admin) offering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products, orders, and users, all managed via the simulated API.
â€¢
UI/UX Enhancements: Integrated skeleton loaders for data fetching, lazy loading for images and components to improve initial load times, toast notifications for immediate user feedback, and subtle micro-animations (Framer Motion) for a fluid user experience.
â€¢
Accessibility: Implemented with Skip Navigation links, proper ARIA landmarks, clear focus outlines for keyboard navigation, and aria-live regions for screen reader compatibility.
â€¢
Responsive Design: Built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring adaptability across various screen sizes (breakpoints at 768px and 1024px).
â€¢
Testing: Includes basic unit tests for atomic components and Redux slices, as well as integration tests for key user flows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”® Future Developments
Potential enhancements for future iterations of the Ridfix project:
â€¢
TypeScript Integration: Migrate the codebase to TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
â€¢
Performance Optimizations: Further optimizations such as image compression, advanced memoization, and virtualization for large lists.
â€¢
End-to-End Testing: Implement E2E tests using Cypress or Playwright for full user flow validation.
â€¢
PWA & Offline Support: Transform the application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities.
â€¢
Internationalization (i18n): Add multi-language support.
â€¢
Deployment Automation (CI/CD): Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployment.
